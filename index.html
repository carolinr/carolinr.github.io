										<h3>User-Centred Vision</h3>

									<p>"It is not what people do with it. It is the experience you create" – Mike Bell at the IDF14. Intel has an experience-driven philosphy in their development that deeply resonates with me. I want to build experiences that matter and Intel is the perfect place for that. How amazing is that?</p>

										<h3>The Next Level in Research</h3>
									</header>
									<p> What is next? Intel is working on new devices and new fields of research that can have an impact on millions of lives. I want to be part of building what is next. Asking the right questions, from the very beginning, push research – It will force myself to learn faster and push to a new level.  </p>

							<h2><span style="font-size: 3em">7</span> </br> Reasons for Intel </br> to Pick Me </h2>
						</header>
						<p> <strong> I cross all discplines. </strong> </br> From Design to software development to research. </br> And I feel at home in all of them. I speak everybody's language as I know </br> how a designer, a developer or a researcher thinks. 
								</p>
								<p> <strong> Analytic thinking and creativity.</strong> </br> I believe they are not two seperate entities, but go </br> excitingly well together and culminate in research that </br>requires every bit of both.
								</p>

								<p> <strong> I love new technologies. </strong> </br> From head-mounted displays, Augmented and Virtual Reality </br> to 3D displays. And quickly creating new ways on how to use them </br> and make it the best experience for the user.   
								</p>
								<p> <strong> Heading out of my comfort zone is my philosphy. </strong> </br> I believe that innovation lies outside the this box. </br> I experienced the best experiences pushing myself heading into </br> unexplored territory, which can be scary and exciting at the same time. </br> But always rewarding.  
								</p>
								<p> <strong> I am a very curious person. </strong> </br> And I like asking questions. Why should a Designer </br> learn to code or go into research? Well, I like to know how things work. </br> And then do whatever it takes to get the answers.   
								</p>

								<p> <strong> Diverse interests match a diverse team. </strong> </br>I have worked in multidisciplinary </br> and international teams which sharpened my skills and sensitivity  </br> in how to communicate in different environments.
								</p>

								<p> <strong> This is not any job. </strong> </br> It literally incorporates everything I am looking for </br> and I am ready to  pour my heart and soul to make fantastic </br> visions happen and push up Intel's capabilities a whole notch.</h2>
